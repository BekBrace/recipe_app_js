# Recipe Finder Web App

Welcome to my Recipe Finder web app repository! 

I did not want to create this -100 times created before app- with React, Vue, Django, Laravel, etc... but with only Vanilla JavaScript.

You can consider it as beginner to intermediate level application that must sharpen your JavaScript skills.

This application allows users to search for recipes based on the name of the dish. 

The data is fetched from TheMealDB API, and the application dynamically displays recipe details, including ingredients and instructions.

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-finder.git
```

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Enter the name of the dish you want to search for in the provided input field.

View the recipe details, including the dish name, image, ingredients, and instructions.

# Code Structure
The main functionality is implemented in the searchRecipe function, which fetches data from TheMealDB API and updates the UI based on the response. Other supporting functions are used for formatting ingredients, instructions, updating the footer, and adjusting the layout.

Dependencies
This application uses the following external dependency:

TheMealDB API - Provides the data for searching recipes.
